                College Confessions is a social platform for college students
                to vent, discuss, support, and connect with each other in an
                open environment. Confessions can be funny, serious, honest,
                exaggerated, offensive, or any combination of the above. We
                ask that you show respect for others and continue to cultivate
                a fun, emapthetic, and open community.

            <h3>Content</h3>
            <p>
                College Confessions strives to be as open, honest, and real as
                possible, however there are some restrictions on what is not 
                okay. Remember that this is a platform for sharing stories and
                confessions with other <i>college students</i> and as such
                the content should be tailored to match.
